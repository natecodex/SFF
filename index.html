        <h2>Charity Events</h2>
        <p>We carry out charity events twice every year for about 7 years now. Our efforts start on the streets of the Adenta Dodowa road, extending to Sota village off the Dodowa road close to Odumse, and Potter's Village Orphanage Home.</p>
        <p>We sponsor many individuals who have deceased parents through school or by setting up a startup for a small business through which they can cater for themselves.</p>
